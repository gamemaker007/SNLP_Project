# Learning Recurrent Span Representations for Extractive Question Answering
Lee et. al. 2017 [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01436)

This code is our implementation of the paper mentioned in pytorch [Link]http://pytorch.org/
Some boilerplate codes are inspired from the original implementation [Link]https://github.com/shimisalant/RaSoR

#### Requirements
pytorch 0.2.0_3 => (if using NYU Prince cluster,  module load pytorch/python3.5/0.2.0_3)
numpy/1.13.1 => (if using NYU Prince cluster, module load numpy/python3.5/intel/1.13.1)


###Trained Model
The trained model can be downloaded from here [Link]

###Results
RaSoR with span representation EM = 59.98, F1 = 70.04
RaSoR with endpoint representation EM = 62.82, F1 = 70.17
