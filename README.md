# Stats NLP Project 2017
Welcome to Stats NLP project on Reading Comprehension by Bhaskar, Karthik and Roshan.
The project has several dependencies that have to be satisfied before running the code. You can install them using your preferred method -- we list here the names of the packages using `pip`.

# Requirements

The starter code provided pressuposes a working installation of Python 2.7, as well as a TensorFlow 0.12.1.

It should also install all needed dependnecies through
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

# Running the code

You can get started by downloading the datasets and doing dome basic preprocessing:

$ code/get_started.sh

Note that you will always want to run your code from the home directory, not the code directory, like so:

$ python code/train.py

This ensures that any files created in the process don't pollute the code directoy.
